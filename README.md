# Overview

StarBot is a fully modular bot â€“ meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your
liking, making it completely customizable. You can turn StarBot into an admin bot, music bot, trivia bot,
new best friend or all of these together!  

**The default set of modules includes and is not limited to:**

- Moderation features (kick/ban/softban/hackban, mod-log, filter, chat cleanup)
- Trivia (lists are included and can be easily added)
- Music features (YouTube, SoundCloud, local files, playlists, queues)
- Stream alerts (Twitch, Youtube, Picarto)
- Bank (slot machine, user credits)
- Custom commands
- Imgur/gif search
- Admin automation (self-role assignment, cross-server announcements, mod-mail reports)
- Customisable command permissions

**Additionally, other plugins (cogs) can be easily found and added from our growing
list of cogs.**
