# Installation

Make sure you have `downloader` installed

```ini
[p]load downloader
```

Next, let's add my repo to your bot

```ini
[p]repo add starcogs https://github.com/LeDeathAmongst/StarCogs
```

Finally, install my cogs

```ini
[p]cog install starcogs cog1, cog2, cog3
```
<sub>Make sure to replace cog1 etc with the cog you wish to install</sub>
