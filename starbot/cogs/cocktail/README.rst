This is the cog guide for the 'Cocktail' cog. This guide
contains the collection of commands which you can use in the cog.

Through this guide, ``[p]`` will always represent your prefix. Replace
``[p]`` with your own prefix when you use these commands in Discord.

    This guide was last updated for version 1.0.0. Ensure
    that you are up to date by running ``[p]cog update cocktail``.
